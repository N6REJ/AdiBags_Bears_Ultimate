Sorts various stuff into their own categories, starting with Dragonflight.

This addon is for special items that don't fit as a profession reagent but I feel would be nice to be catergorized.
They include but are not limited to..
1) Food
2) Pots
3) phials
4) crafting tools
5) Trinket reagents
6) Knowledge
7) Items to turn in
8) Primordial Stones
9) Special items such as Zserka vault key
10) Forbidden reach combine items.
11) Rep items
12) Toys
13) Weapon enhancements
and more...

If something is not here that you feel would be a good fit or if you find a bug, feel free to create an [Issue](http://github.com/N6REJ/AdiBags_Bears_Ultimate/issues)
