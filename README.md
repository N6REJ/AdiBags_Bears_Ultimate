Sorts All Reagents and crafting stuff into their own categories, starting with Shadowlands.

# THIS ADDON IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA!
## MANY THINGS ARE MISSING AND ARE BEING UPDATED, SOMETIMES, HOURLY
### Best way to stay up to date is to do a "git pull" anytime you want to update.
Once everything is completed it will be released onto wago & curseforge.
I hope to have that done by the middle of december.
Feel free to create an issue if you wish to comment or contribute in some manor.


NOTE: This addon while it is designed to be complete will, by its very nature, be heavy on your bag sorting.
For this reason I encourage you to use the individual addons that are more optimized then this is.
I will be updating the single profession/category addons simultaneous to this one.
This addon includes every profession and a few extra things where the other addons
on [![curse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Curseforge-brown)](https://authors.curseforge.com/dashboard/projects) [![curse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wago-orange)](https://addons.wago.io/user/BearLeeAble) are for single crafting
professions and categories so are highly optimized.
